# Monte_Carlo_Simulation

## Overview
This is a Python project that simulates the Premier League season using Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation is based on the expected goals (xG) of each team in the league. The xG values are used to generate the number of goals scored by each team in each match. The simulation is run multiple times to generate the final league table.
